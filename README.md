# Employee-Tracker
Application to keep track of employee's at a company

This is a web application that is used to record the employee record at a company.  In the application you can add new employee's, and add the employee's position at the company.  This information is then displayed where it can be edited or deleted.  This application was created with MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, and Node.

If you want to run this application you will need to:

1.Have a Node installed on your computer

2.Create a free MongoDB Atlas acount

3.Create a local cluster on MongoDB Atlas

If you have all of these things, all you have to do is download the repository and run the command "npm install" comman inside the repository. Finally you will need to replace the Atlas_Url with the Atlas_Url for your MongoDb cluster.

Now you are all set.  To start the application you have to enter the backend folder with your comand line and type in "nodemon server".  This will connect your app to your mongoDB database.  Finally you will have to enter the main project folder in your command line and type in "npm start".  This will start up the web application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
